/// @file DriveToPose.cpp
/// @brief Implementation of DriveToPose command for autonomous pose-based navigation
/// @details This command provides a base class for driving the robot to specific field poses using a combination
///          of feedforward and PID control. The control system uses:
///          - Separate ProfiledPIDControllers for X and Y translation
///          - Feedforward velocity scaling based on distance to target
///          - Heading control to face a target direction
///          - Adaptive PID reset to handle large position errors
///
///          The command is designed to be extended by derived classes that provide specific target poses
///          for different field elements or game-specific locations.

/// @brief      Constructor for DriveToPose command
/// @param[in]  chassis - Pointer to the swerve drive subsystem used for navigation
/// @details    Initializes the command with the following configuration:
///
///             **PID Controller Setup:**
///             - Creates separate ProfiledPIDControllers for X and Y axes
///             - Configures I-Zone (integral zone) to prevent integral windup
///             - Uses trapezoidal motion profiles for smooth acceleration/deceleration
///
///             **Initial State:**
///             - Captures current robot pose as the previous pose reference
///             - Calculates feedforward range (max radius - min radius) for velocity scaling
///             - Registers chassis as a required subsystem
///
///             **Control Strategy:**
///             The command combines feedforward and feedback control:
///             - Feedforward: Provides base velocity towards target (scaled by distance)
///             - PID Feedback: Applies corrections for precise positioning
///             - Heading Control: Rotates robot to face target direction
