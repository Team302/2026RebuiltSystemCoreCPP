/// @class DriveToTower
/// @brief Command to autonomously drive the robot to the nearest Tower on the field
///
/// This command extends DriveToPose to provide specific functionality for navigating to Towers.
/// It automatically determines which Tower (red or blue) is closest to the robot's current position
/// and calculates the target pose at the center of that Tower using TowerHelper.
///
/// The command uses PID control to drive the robot to the calculated Towercenter position,
/// making it useful for autonomous routines or driver assistance features during matches.
