///             the two-stage path as follows:
///
///             **Mid Pose**
///             - X: robot's current X-coordinate (no lateral shift yet)
///             - Y: Y-coordinate of the first (near-trench) position returned
///               by TrenchHelper::GetTrenchDrivePositions()
///             - Rotation: as specified by TrenchHelper for the near side
///
///             **End Pose**
///             - The last position in the TrenchHelper vector (far side of trench)
///             - If TrenchHelper returns only one pose, that pose is used for both
///               mid and end
///
///             The mid pose keeps the robot's current X so it first aligns on
///             the Y axis before committing to the full trench crossing.
///
/// @note       This override enables the two-stage navigation required to
///             safely align with and cross through the field trench
