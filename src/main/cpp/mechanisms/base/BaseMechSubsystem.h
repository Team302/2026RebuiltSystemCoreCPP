/// @class BaseMechSubsystem
/// @brief Command-based base class for robot mechanisms.
///
/// This is the command-based replacement for the old @c StateMgr base class. A
/// mechanism derives from @c BaseMechSubsystem to gain:
///   - @c BaseMech behavior (mechanism type, network-table name, control-data reading)
///   - @c frc2::SubsystemBase behavior (automatic registration with the
///     @c CommandScheduler so @c Periodic() runs every loop, plus default-command
///     and requirement support for command bindings)
///
/// Mechanism behavior that used to live in individual @c State classes is now
/// expressed as @c frc2::CommandPtr factories on the concrete mechanism, and the
/// per-loop housekeeping that used to live in @c StateMgr::RunCommonTasks() now
/// lives in the overridden @c Periodic().
