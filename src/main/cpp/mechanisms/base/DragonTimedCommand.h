/// @brief Command base class that automatically times a command's @c Initialize() and @c Execute()
///        work and logs it inside the owning mechanism's table.
///
/// This uses the non-virtual-interface (template method) pattern so timing is completely automatic:
/// the scheduler calls the @c final @c Initialize() / @c Execute() defined here, which wrap a timer
/// around the protected @c Init() / @c Run() hooks. Derived commands override those hooks instead of
/// @c Initialize() / @c Execute() and never call any timing code themselves.
/// (The hooks are named @c Init() / @c Run() because a wrapper method cannot share the name of the
/// method it wraps; @c Initialize() / @c Execute() are dispatched by the scheduler to this base.)
///
/// The timing group is the owning mechanism's network-table name, so a command's timing appears
/// alongside the mechanism's other data, e.g. @c "Launcher/LauncherIdle Initialize (ms)".
///
/// @note Timing only happens when enabled from the dashboard (see @c DragonTimedClass); when off,
///       the hooks are still called but no timing/logging overhead is incurred.
