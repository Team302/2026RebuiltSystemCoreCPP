/**
 * @class DragonVisionPoseEstimator
 * @brief Fuses vision measurements with swerve drivetrain odometry to maintain an accurate field pose.
 *
 * This command periodically reads target observations from DragonVision and injects
 * corrected poses or measurements into the drivetrain pose estimator (via the swerve chassis)
 * to reduce odometry drift. It is intended to run while the robot is enabled and can be
 * scheduled continuously (does not normally terminate by itself).
 *
 * Key behaviors:
 * - Attempts to set an initial absolute pose when a reliable vision target is first seen
 *   (CalculateInitialPose / m_initialPoseSet).
 * - On each Execute(), valid vision measurements are transformed and handed to the chassis
 *   pose estimator using AddVisionMeasurements().
 * - ResetPosition() can be used to force a drivetrain pose reset from external code.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Construct and schedule at robot initialization or when vision-based pose updates are desired.
 * - Ensure DragonVision provides properly timestamped/filtered detections for best results.
