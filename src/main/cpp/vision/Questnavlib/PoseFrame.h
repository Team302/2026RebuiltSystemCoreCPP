/**
 * Represents a single frame of pose tracking data received from the Quest headset.
 *
 * This struct encapsulates all the information needed to integrate Quest tracking data with FRC
 * pose estimation systems. Each frame represents a single tracking measurement from the Quest's
 * visual-inertial odometry system.
 *
 * Two timestamps are provided for different use cases:
 *   - dataTimestamp: NetworkTables reception time — use this for pose estimation
 *   - appTimestamp:  Quest internal time — use only for debugging/diagnostics
 *
 * The pose data follows WPILib field coordinate conventions:
 *   - X-axis: Forward (towards opposing alliance)
 *   - Y-axis: Left (when facing forward)
 *   - Rotation: Counter-clockwise positive
 *   - Units: Meters for translation, radians for rotation
