/**
 * The QuestNav class provides a comprehensive interface for communicating with an Oculus/Meta
 * Quest VR headset for robot localization and tracking in FRC robotics applications.
 *
 * This class handles all aspects of Quest-robot communication including:
 *   - Real-time pose tracking and localization data
 *   - Command sending and response handling
 *   - Device status monitoring (battery, tracking state, connectivity)
 *   - NetworkTables-based communication protocol
 *
 * Basic Usage:
 *   // Create QuestNav instance
 *   QuestNav questNav;
 *
 *   // Set initial robot pose (required for field-relative tracking)
 *   questNav.SetPose(wpi::math::Pose3d{...});
 *
 *   // In robot periodic methods
 *   questNav.CommandPeriodic(); // Process command responses
 *   auto frames = questNav.GetAllUnreadPoseFrames();
 *
 * Coordinate Systems:
 *   - X-axis: Forward direction (towards opposing alliance)
 *   - Y-axis: Left direction (when facing forward)
 *   - Rotation: Counter-clockwise positive (standard mathematical convention)
 *   - Units: Meters for translation, radians for rotation
 *
 * Threading and Performance:
 *   - All methods are thread-safe for typical FRC usage patterns
 *   - NetworkTables handles the underlying communication asynchronously
 *   - Call CommandPeriodic() regularly to process command responses
 *
 * Error Handling:
 *   - Methods return std::optional types when data might not be available
 *   - Connection status can be checked with IsConnected()
 *   - Tracking status can be monitored with IsTracking()
 *   - Command failures are reported through DriverStation error logging
